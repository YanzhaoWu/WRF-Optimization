The namelist.input file also provides control over the number and shape
   of the tiling WRF uses within each patch. On most systems, the default
   tiling will be only over the Y dimension; the X dimension is left
   undecomposed over tiles. This default behavior is defined in
   frame/module_machine.F in the routine init_module_machine. The default
   number of tiles per patch is 1 if the code is not compiled for OpenMP
   or the value of the OpenMP function omp_get_max_threads(). This default
   is defined in frame/module_tiles.F in the routine set_tiles2. The
   default number of tiles may be overridden by setting the variable
   numtiles to a value greater than 1 in the domains section of the
   namelist.input file. Or the default shape of a tile can be specified by
   setting tile_sz_x and tile_sz_y in the domains section of the
   namelist.input file. These will override both the default tiling and
   numtiles if it is set.
